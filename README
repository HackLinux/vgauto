Auto configure vpngate setting, for ubuntu12.04

    Vpngate has been popular since 2013, but it does not have a user friendly interface on Linux, so I make this script for my convience. Of course, if you find it useful, you may also use it.
    
    This script is used in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, I'm not sure if it works on other linux dists, and if I have some free time, may be I will. If you have interest, you may test it by your own. It will only modify you vpncmd account settings(add an account setting), as well as you route table settings, no further modifications.
    




usage:  [sudo ]python ./start_vpn.py


info:   
        0. install vpngate client;
        1. start your vpnclient service, usually run "vpnclient start" command in terminal;
        2. you must have access to route table;
        3. if you haven't access to 'http://vpngate.net/en/', you can use a local proxy '127.0.0.1:8087', the proxy is written statically in the script, you can change it as you wish:);
        4. default gateway is 192.168.0.1, if not you can change it in script.


TO DO:
        ip route:
            10.211.0.0/16 dev vpn_vg  proto kernel  scope link  src 10.211.1.54
        currently is static in the script, make it dynamic with dhcp
